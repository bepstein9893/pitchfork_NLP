[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/) is an American online music publication that regularly posts reviews and ratings of recently released / reissued albums. After gaining immense readership since its launch in 1995, [it has been suggested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800457.html) that the positive or negative quality of Pitchfork's reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity. In fact, Pitchfork has been [accused](https://slate.com/culture/2006/11/the-indie-music-site-that-everyone-loves-to-hate.html) deliberately writing provocative and contrarian reviews in order to attract attention--it has been criticized for its airs of cynicism and elitism as well. All the while, the publication has had the reputation that its reviews are unpredicatable and very dependent on which of its reviewers/contributors writes the review.
